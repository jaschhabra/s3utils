Ruby s3 utils that use AWS SDK to work easily with IAM roles.

Installation
-------------

    gem install s3utils

Setting up gem
---------------

AWS configuration is taken from one of the following places in the order
given:

 1. If Environment Variable AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE is set, it will
    look in the file. The file should have at least two lines:Â·


AWSAccessKeyId=A34554D...

AWSSecretKey=ACF4545666...

    
 2. Environment Variables:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 
    
 3. If you are running this in an EC2 instance with IAM role, this will
    automatically pick up the configuration

If you are behind a proxy, set the environment variable:
HTTPS_PROXY='https://user:password@my.proxy:443/'
